### Linting and Formatting

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before opening a PR, please run the following command to ensure that your code is formatted and doesn't upset the Ruff linter:**
> 
> ```sh
> python formatlint.py
> ```
> 
> Or alternatively, run the following commands individually:
> 
> ```sh
> ruff format . && ruff check --include I --fix . #  format code and sort imports
> ruff check . # Run linting and perform fixes accordingly, or use '# noqa: <RULE>' followed by a comment justifying why the rule is ignored
